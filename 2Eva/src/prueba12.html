            HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
            When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

            An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
            
            Here are some examples of HTML events:
            
            An HTML web page has finished loading
            An HTML input field was changed
            An HTML button was clicked
            Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
            
            JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
            
            HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
            
            With single quotes:
            
            <some-HTML-element some-event='some JavaScript'>
            With double quotes:
            
            <some-HTML-element some-event="some JavaScript">
            In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a button element:
            
            <button onclick='getElementById("demo").innerHTML=Date()'>The time is?</button>
        -->
